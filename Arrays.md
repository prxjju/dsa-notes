DEFINITION

Arrays- Linear data structure which is used to store the elements of similar data type

PATTERNS

  - SORTING
  - PREFIX SUM + HASHMAP (https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/5106455/MASTER-PREFIX-SUM-%2B-HASH-MAP-TECHNIQUE).
    We apply this approach in problems related to Subarrays, problems where we are asked to
    Count the subarrays with some condition
    Find Maximum Length Subarray with some condition
    Check if subarray exists with some given condition
    Mainly the problems dealing with Subarray sum
  - Kadane's Algorithm
  - Moore's Voting Algorithm
